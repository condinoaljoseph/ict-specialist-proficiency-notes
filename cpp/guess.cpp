/*
Inside guess.cpp, we have a program that asks the user to 
guess a number between 1-10 and the answer is 8!
Now instead of just asking for the user to answer it once, 
letâ€™s add a while loop so that they answer it up to 50 times!

  while (guess != 8 && tries < 50) {
    std::cout << "Wrong guess, try again: ";
